This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

## Clear console on each execute and set chunk default to not show code

cat('\014')

## Download and load libraries

if(!require("DBI"))
  install.packages("DBI")
if(!require("dplyr"))
  install.packages("dplyr")
# if(!require("readr"))
#   install.packages("readr")

library(DBI)
#library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Connect (and create) a new local SQLite DB

conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "daie_ca4_data.sqlite")

# list all team members
result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM TeamMembers")
result


# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT wt, disp, mpg FROM mtcars")
# result

# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE mpg >= 18 AND mpg <= 22")
# result

# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE mpg >= 18 AND mpg <= 22 ORDER BY hp ASC LIMIT 4")
# result

# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE mpg >= 18 AND mpg <= 22 ORDER BY hp ASC LIMIT 4")
# result

# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT COUNT(mpg) FROM mtcars WHERE mpg > 25")
# result
# 
# result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT AVG(hp) FROM mtcars")
# result
#issue with push
# Execute a query with no result

result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM ca4")
result 

dbExecute(conn, "DELETE FROM ca4 WHERE mpg <= 20")

result <-  dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM ca4")
result

# Do NOT forget to disconnect - otherwise we may hit a remote connection limit

dbDisconnect(conn)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
